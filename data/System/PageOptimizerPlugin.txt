---++ Description

This plugin is used to clean up the html page foswiki renders by rewriting
and/or removing code not required in html5. It also compresses all stylesheets and
javascript code used in a page thus reducing the number of http requests that are
normally required to load a page including all of its assets.

These changes only apply to output of type =text/html=, not to any other kind of output.

---++ Rewrite of html markup

The following list of transformations is performed:

   * all one-liner html comments are removed
   * any markup following the closing =&lt;/html>= is removed
   * sequences of =&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>...= are collapsed into one
   * script blocks of type =text/javascript= don't need a =type= argument anymore as
     that's the default in html5
   * style blocks of type =text/css= don't need a =type= argument anymore as
     that's the default in html5
   * citations produced by foswiki's =&gt;= at the beginning of a line are
     collapsed into one =&lt;div>= block of type =foswikiCite=, or =foswikiBlockCite=
     when there are multiple citation lines following
   * =&lt;verbatim>= blocks contained in template comments are rewritten to look nicer
     for better readability of view templates coded in topics

---++ Combining and compressing stylesheets and javascript

<nop>%TOPIC% is reading all css and js files loaded into a page and combines them into
one each. Only stylesheets for =media="all"= are processed. Media-specific styles
aren't touched. All css files are parsed and rewritten so that contained =@import()=
and =url()= statements are working as expected.

The combined css (js) files are cached and reused by pages that have the same
profile of assets loaded into the page. Or expressed the other way around: each page
that differs in the set of assets will get its own combined stylesheet (javascript).
This is still object of optimization. 

<nop>%TOPIC% is able to gather statistics about how often specific css (js)
files have been used while combining them with others.  This feature is
switched off by default but can be enabled using the ={GatherStatistics}=
switch in =configure=. Once statistics are enabled, the plugin will record css
and js use.  Results can be printed out using the =statistics= REST handler.
For now, this is a rather crude statistic how often css (js) file have been
used per pages visited. E.g. a value of 100% means: this asset has been used on
all pages, whereas lower values indicate a decreasing frequency of those files
being used.

All css and js files will be cached in plain text as well as encoded =gzip= compressed
for browsers supporting on-the-fly decompression of js and css files.

The cache of stylesheets and javascript files can be refreshed manually by using
the =refresh= url parameter:

   * %SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?refresh=on (or cache): refresh the css and js cache for the current page
   * %SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?refresh=css : refresh the css files of the current page
   * %SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?refresh=js : refresh the js files of the current page
   * %SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?refresh=all : purge the complete cache
